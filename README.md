# Exercises to practice array enumeration methods and callbacks in javascript

Practise using:
- `Array.map()`
- `Array.filter()`
- `Array.sort()`
- `Array.every()`
- `Array.reduce()`

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to pass functions to higher-order functions
- Be able to use built-in Array enumeration methods

## Brief
You have been given four projects, each containing a coding problem. You should write the code to make the tests pass, without modifying the spec files. You should use JavaScript's built-in enumerator methods where appropriate.

### UPPERCASER

Transform an array of strings into a new array containing uppercase versions of each string

### Pangram Finder

A pangram is a sentence or phrase that contains every letter of the alphabet.

> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Given a phrase or sentence you should be able to determine whether or not it is an pangram.

### Isogram Finder

An isogram is a word, phrase or sentence that does not contain repeated letters.

>  "Orange" ✓

>  "Banana" ✕

Given a word, phrase or sentence you should be able to determine whether or not it is an isogram.

### Anagram Finder

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

> "listen" is an anagram of "silent"

Given a word and an array of other words, find the words that are an anagram of the first word.
